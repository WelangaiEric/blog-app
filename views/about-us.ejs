									<p>i write when I'm overwhelmed and/or anxious 
										i write so that i can forget
										but the irony is that i remember everything i write. 
										Reading other people's writings gives me a sense of belongingâ€” a safe space 
										that maybe I'm not the only one feeling things they can't explain 
										Somewhere in between these lines is a version of me that felt it, lived it and survived it
										This, this is my whole heart  
										a sustenance; a need; a survival guide
										i don't know yet all of who i was
										i don't know yet all of who i am
										i don't know yet all of who i want to be
										but I'm going to write as i find other interesting things to do before I die
										so here are my half written stories; finished without an endingðŸ¦‹</p>
